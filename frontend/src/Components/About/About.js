          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Fullstack Developer from Barcelona, and I love building
          web applications that are easy to use and fast. My main tools are
          React, Django, JavaScript, and Python, and I enjoy working on both
          frontend and backend. I especially like creating and consuming APIs,
          fixing performance issues, and making workflows smoother.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didnâ€™t plan to work in tech at first. It started because I was
          curious and I liked solving problems and understanding how things work.
          Over time, this became my job. Iâ€™ve worked on different projects,
          from small websites to company tools, handling everything from design
          to deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best part of my work is learning new things. Every project teaches
          me something. Maybe a better way to write code, how to automate tasks,
          or how to improve a design. I believe in teamwork, always improving,
          and staying curious, no matter how much experience I have.
        </p>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a work in progress. Just like me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by!
